HELLO THERE!

This is my attempt at a little BMI Calculator in Android Studio.

The app clasifies you according to you BMI, which is calculated by taking your weight and height.

If you're lazy, here is a screenshot so you can be heavily impressed by my excellence.

THE BORING STUFF :/

The application is made using JAVA.

The Minimum SDK is API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop). It will run on 98.8% of android devices.
